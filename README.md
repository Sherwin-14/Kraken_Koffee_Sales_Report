# Kraken Coffee Sales Project

## Problem Statement

**Kraken Coffee**, a renowned chain of coffee shops, is on a mission to enhance the performance of its three stores located in Florida. Despite a steady stream of customers, the stores have been experiencing inconsistent sales and varying levels of customer satisfaction. The primary goal of this project is to delve into the performance metrics of these stores and pinpoint the elements causing these discrepancies.

Our strategy involves the development of a detailed infographic that encapsulates crucial performance indicators such as sales volume, customer traffic, and customer satisfaction scores. This visual tool will serve as a guide to comprehend the prevailing performance patterns and spot potential areas for enhancement. The overarching objective is to utilize these insights to boost store performance, escalate customer satisfaction, and augment overall profitability in a real-world business scenario.

## Tech Stack

The project leverages the following technologies:

- **Power BI**: Used for data analysis and visualization.
- **PowerPoint**: Utilized for building dashboard background.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges faced during the project was forecasting the performance for the next half of the year. The data available was only for the first half of the year, making it difficult to predict future trends and performance. Despite this limitation, we strived to make accurate predictions based on the available data and industry trends. This challenge added an extra layer of complexity to the project but also provided an opportunity to innovate and think critically about how to best use the data at hand.
